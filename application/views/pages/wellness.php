                <p class="description">Annual dental exams and cleanings are recommended to protect your pet from many health problems and help them maintain a healthy and clean mouth.
                <br/>Many health problems start in the mouth. Plaque, tartar, periodontal disease, and infected teeth serve as a source of inflammation and infection for the rest of the body.
                        Dental disease is one of the most common problems that we see in dogs and cats. It can cause drooling, reluctance to eat, swelling, bad breath, redness of the gums, loose teeth and tooth discoloration.

                <h4 class="title">Vaccination</h4>
                <p class="description">Vaccinations are vital to the health and protection of your pet, and serve as a preventive measure in combating viral diseases like Parvovirus, Parainfluenza virus, Distemper, Lyme, Panleukopenia, Feline Leukemia Virus, and Rabies.
                <br/>
                Vaccines help to combat diseases by exposing the pet's immune system to inactive or small amounts of a particular form of bacteria or virus. Vaccines are administered through a subcutaneous injection (under the skin), orally, or intra-nasally, depending on the vaccine.</p>

                <p class="description">Deworming is an important preventative care regime for reducing parasites (internal and external) and improving your pet's health. It is also important to help to prevent transmission of parasites to you and your human family members
                    <br/> Parasites such as fleas and ticks can be very damaging to your petâ€™s health. Preventive measures should be taken year-round to inhibit potential outbreaks.
                    <br/><br/>Fleas:
                    Flea infestations can lead to anemia and fleas are also capable of transmitting serious diseases.
                    <br/>Ticks:
                    Some tick bites only cause mild irritation or swelling at the site, but other tick bites can infect your pet with serious illnesses. If left untreated, these diseases, such as lyme, can lead to more severe health problems or even be fatal.

                <br/>Wellness exams give us a chance to evaluate the overall health of your pet while also giving us a baseline for their own unique bodies and tendencies. They also allow us to detect potential problems before they become serious, and even make your pet more familiar with our veterinary hospital, making future visits easier on them and you.
